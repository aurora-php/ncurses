ncurses
=======

OOP ncurses library for PHP. This is version >= 1.x.x, which features completly different
filenames (dropped .class from file extension) and namespaces to make things compatible 
with the [PSR-4 autoloading](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) standard and to make it
installable und usable with [composer](http://getcomposer.org/).

The previous version was tagged v0.0.0 and is still available at [github](https://github.com/octris/ncurses/tree/v0.0.0).

Note
----

Some features available by this library require the latest ncurses php extension. I am 
maintaining my own inofficial pecl_ncurses fork at https://github.com/octris/pecl_ncurses . 
I am sending all my patches to the pecl_ncurses maintainers, too, but i can not guarantee, 
that they will get accepted.
